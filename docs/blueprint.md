## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #5DADE2, a serene blue, evokes trust and reliability. Blue is reminiscent of sites like Amazon.
- Background color: #F0F8FF, a very light tint of blue, provides a clean, non-intrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: #6495ED, slightly darker than the primary, adds depth to interactive elements, offering users clarity and clear visual feedback.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will be used for both headlines and body text. Inter's clean lines give the site a neutral, up-to-date look.
- Implement a mobile-first responsive layout using a grid system (such as Tailwind's grid) to ensure the application is accessible and functional on various screen sizes.
- Use subtle animations, such as fade-ins and transitions, when displaying new deals or when users interact with the search/filter options to create a smooth and engaging user experience.
